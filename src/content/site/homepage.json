Improvements in re-usability, extensibility, interoperability and maintainability of solutions will improve manufacturing throughput and quality and reduce cost directly. Key DT framework capabilities such as virtual commissioning will facilitate faster and lower-cost ramp-up.",
      "A common framework will allow the benefits to extend to the entire manufacturing ecosystem and will enhance capabilities such as security and customer responsiveness. Lastly the Center will promote workforce development and empowerment by establishing environments and solutions for training, benchmarking and collaboration between competitors, suppliers, and customers in a technical, pre-competitive forum."

    "sectionTitle": "Greater Context",
    "lead": "Digital Twins (DTs) have become pervasive in the manufacturing industry. Here we adopt the DT definition of [Moyne et al.], that a digital twin is some level of purpose-driven replica of a real thing (the physical twin) and is synchronized with its physical twin (equipment, component, process, product, etc.). Leveraging historical and real-time data, as well as data-driven and first-principles models, DTs in disparate forms have been used to solve manufacturing problems such as predictive maintenance and model-based process control.",

The NSF-funded Center for Digital Twins will bring together a group of industry partners and academics for collaborative research to develop DTs across a common framework to help improve manufacturing solutions."

NSF supports the administration and operation of IUCRCs. Industry partners support the research projects through their membership dues and choose the specific research projects that the center will execute."
